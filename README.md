## Lucky Streak

You're a block. You're naked (don't worry, it's censored). You're out for a jog. Run and jump as far as you can. Avoid stepping on cracks in the sidewalk or your luck may run out as the earth opens up to swallow you whole. Good luck!

This game was developed for the 2013 js13kGames competition (http://js13kgames.com/).  The theme of the competition was "Bad Luck".
